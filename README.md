# About Chaut
Chaut is a messaging app made with the MERN stack, React and vanilla CSS for the frontend, MongoDB as database and Node/express for the backend.

- I also use pusher for getting and posting the messages in real time (no refreshing).
- Deployed with Firebase for the frontend and Heroku for the backend.
- I used some hooks, props, react router and context API.
- Easy and secure authentication with google.
- Mobile friendly (Can be improved)
- Icons provided by Material-Ui.
- Logo and favicon designed by me using photoshop.

# Important
Disclaimer: The messages are NOT encrypted, so messages are stored in my database!!! Do NOT write sensitive information. Chaut is a webapp for showing off my skills, ItÂ´s not a production work.
